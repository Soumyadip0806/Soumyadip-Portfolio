Soumyadip's Portfolio website [React Project]

Live Preview: Open Link

Made with ❤️ by Soumyadip Ghosh


# Project Details
A portfolio for a web designer. We used React js to make this portfolio. A clean design with full responsiveness. You will find this portfolio very professional. Also, we added a smooth scroll in the portfolio which will make the scroll experience really elegant.

This is a beginner-friendly react js project. This project is made for education purposes by me. I learned so many things through this project especially how to work with React Js. React Js is one of the hottest techs for web dev. Through this project, I will have a good understanding of react js. Besides React js I am going to use many other techs.


# Project Requirement
HTML, CSS
JavaScript
React Basic (optional)

# What we are going to Use/learn
React
React Hooks
Styled Components
Swiper js
React Transition Group
Smooth Scrollbar
React Icons
React Router Dom
More...


# Starter Files
For the starter files, we created a branch in this repository named starter_files. You need to change the branch in the top corner of the repo then you will get the starter files and now you can clone the repo or download it.

# Getting Started
The recommended way to get started with the project is to Follow the YouTube tutorial. You will find all the step-by-step guides for free. Or you Can start the project on your own by following the guide below.

After getting the starter files, you need to go to the file directory and run

npm install
and after that start the live server.

npm start

This website is made for educational purposes. Also, this will be free to use. Though a proper credit will be appreciated.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
